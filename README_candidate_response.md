# Step 1: Clarify and Frame the Problem

This document is a guide for the first step in a case study interview: briefly stating the user journey, then clarifying and framing the problem. The goal is to remove ambiguity, align on success metrics, and define constraints before proposing solutions.

## Outcome of Step 1

By the end of this step, you should have:

- A clear restatement of the problem
- The target surface and user segment
- A primary success metric (north-star)
- Key constraints and risks
- A shared understanding of scope and time horizon

## Start With a Brief User Journey

Keep this to 1–2 sentences to set context before you ask questions.

**Example**: “Users discover items via home feed or search, evaluate on item pages, and take actions like click, save, or bid.”

## Clarifying Questions (Short List)

Keep this crisp to avoid interview fatigue. Ask only what you must know to proceed.

- Which surface are we optimizing (home feed, search, item page)?
- What is the north-star metric and key guardrail?
- Which user segment and journey stage matter most?
- What data is available (impressions, clicks, bids, saves)?
- Any hard constraints (latency, freshness/diversity, integrity)?

## Suggested Framing Statement (Example)

“We’re improving recommendations for the home feed to increase qualified engagement while respecting freshness and diversity. I’ll start with a simple baseline, define success metrics, and then propose a stronger model with an evaluation plan.”
